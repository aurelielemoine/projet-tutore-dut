## Presentation
The Networks & Telecoms department offers apprenticeship training allowing students to discover the professional world by alternating between periods at the IUT and periods in business. To allow the apprenticeship master and teachers to follow the development of the work-study student's skills during the year, an educational tool has been put in place: a paper booklet.
The objective of our project is to transfer this booklet to digital format, i.e. to create a website.
→ Different user sessions
→ IUT and Company period
→ Electronic signature
